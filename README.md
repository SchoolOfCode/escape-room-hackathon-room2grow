Welcome to the Escape Room Hackathon! This hackathon will guide you through creating an interactive escape room experience where participants must solve logic puzzles to progress through the game. The goal is to create an escape room that can be shared and enjoyed by others, all without writing a single line of code.

Criteria 🎯
A plan of your escape room logic and narrative, utilising a flow chart and making sure you have incremental sprint targets that mean you achieve your MVP. The plans should be committed to your hackathon GitHub repo.
Create an interactive escape room experience that can be shared and enjoyed by others using Scratch - your MVP should be the basic functionality of a single challenge.
Reflect on how you approached creating your escape room in a team retrospective, and analyse how you what you could do to improve your approach in future.
Don't Forget❗
To make the most of this hackathon, remember these important reminders:

Setup Checklist ✅
Download the Scratch programming interface.
Use a program like draw.io to create your flow chart plan, using all the concepts visited in your SOC journey so far.
Work in pairs and switch who is doing the Scratch manipulation.
Use git and GitHub to share work.
Review the provided documentation and resources.
If you encounter any issues, don't hesitate to ask for help from your peers or instructors.
Stretch Goals 🌟
While the success criteria outline the minimum requirements, we encourage you to challenge yourself by attempting the following stretch goals:

Incorporate additional elements, such as sound effects or animation, to enhance the escape room experience.
Test the escape room with participants outside of the development team and incorporate their feedback.
Create multiple linked rooms or scenarios that build into a bigger narrative.
Hackathon Best Practices 💪
To ensure a smooth and enjoyable hackathon experience, please consider the following best practices:

Partner Switching 👯
The planning stage should be collaborative by sharing a draw.io (or similar) link with each other.
Communicate openly and respectfully with your partners, sharing ideas and supporting each other's growth.
During the build phase, the partner driving the building in Scratch should switch every 15 minutes - this means we should see a commit in the git history every 15 minutes.
Time Management ⏰
Prioritise tasks
Allocate time accordingly to stay on track
Focus on delivering your MVP first, and then iterate and layer on features and functionality to improve it
Creative Problem Solving 💡
Think outside the box and explore innovative solutions
Don't be afraid to experiment and iterate on your ideas
Embrace Challenges and Have Fun! 😄
Remember, the hackathon is not just about the end result but also about learning, growing, and enjoying the process. Embrace challenges, ask questions, and have fun with your fellow participants!

It’s all about the collaboration and the learning remember!!!

Now go create amazing projects together! Good luck! 🎉👩‍💻👨‍💻

A little starting help:
If you like, you can install this plugin to VSCode to allow you to use draw.io directly in the VSCode interface

Plan your project, but try to make your stages of development MVPs so that you can always have something to test and show

Download this Scratch editor so we can collaborate on a Scratch project with git

Scratch - Scratch Offline Editor

If you can’t, don’t worry - work through your partners computer

Clone down this repo onto your local computer

Create a Scratch project using the local offline editor, and save it into the repo (you can choose the file location when saving the Scratch project

Now start your usual project flow (group programming, add/commit/push your progress and the next person pulls down to begin)
